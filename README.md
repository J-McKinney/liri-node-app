# liri-node-app

In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Description:
* LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
* Liri takes in a command from the terminal, using command line node. Node then makes a call to specific API's and retrieves certain information
to present to the user.
* By using Spotify, Axios(OMDB and BandsInTown), and MomentJS. The user can access information about a given movie, song or concert that they
desire.
* My goal of this project is to understand Back-End Programming and how to utilize NPM's and Modules, along with importing and exporting data.

## Instructions:
1. Fork the code to you preferred coding app.
2. Open your terminal on the liri.js file.
3. Download the NPM package and check to see if it's the correct edition.
4. By using the code: 
* First: node liri.js
  - Followed with: spotify-this, movie-this, concert-this, or do-what-it-says
  - With the exception of do-what-it-says
  - Follow the first three with either a spotify song, a movie, or an upcoming concert of your choice
5. The final look of the code in your terminal should look like this:
* node liri.js movie-this jurassic park
* node liri.js spotify-this red hot chili peppers
* node liri.js concert-this slash
* node liri.js do-what-it-says
6. The terminal will then show the user information on the command they gave.
7. If no movie, song, or concert was typed in. The program will run its default choice for that command line.
8. And finally, have fun! Go nuts!
